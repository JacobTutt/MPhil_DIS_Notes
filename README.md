## Description
This repository contains a collection of my **handwritten notes** from my Masters in Data Intensive Science (MPhil) at the University of Cambridge. The course provides rigorous training in advanced computational tools, statistical analysis, and machine learning in response to the data revolution transforming the physical sciences - from the High-Luminosity LHC to the Square Kilometre Array.

Additionally, the repository includes notes from theoretical astrophysics courses offered by the Institute of Astronomy and the Cavendish Astrophysics Group. These notes aim to provide a detailed and accessible resource for key topics covered, and I hope they prove valuable to other students on related courses and serve as a useful revision aid.
